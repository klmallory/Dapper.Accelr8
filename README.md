# Dapper.Accelr8
A Dapper Based Data Access Framework with Templating, I've included templates with some pieces from
SubSonic, and Peta Poco;
Also https://www.nuget.org/packages/T4,
And Damien G's output template https://damieng.com/blog/2009/11/06/multiple-outputs-from-t4-made-easy-revisited

The inspiration for this wrapper for dapper is the idea of a templating system that is more friendly for nLayer and distributed environments than most dapper tools. I've given a lot of thought to the repository pattern over the years and decided less is more, leaner is cleaner. In addition I wanted something flexible that could be manipulated to generate the SQL I want without generating the sql manually. I still think it's bad practice to try to embed SQL functionality into a domain, and conversely to pass SQL directly across application layer boundaries. So a simple flexible query syntax was constructed for this purpose. Eventually I would like to support LINQ querying directly on the repository, but that will require more time than I have now to invest in it.

Currently I only support SQL Server 2008, 2012 and above. Technically I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work in SQL Server 2005, please let me know if you find issues with any version.

## How to install

For single project data access layer run this command using the nuget command line tool in your data access project:
Install-Package Dapper.Accelr8.Sql

It will automatically include these references:
  Dapper
  Dapper.Accelr8.Repo
  Dapper.Accelr8.Domain

For distributed projects run these commands:
Run Install-Package Dapper.Accelr8.Sql in your SQL layer.
Remove the binary references to:
Dapper.Accelr8.Repo
Dapper.Accelr8.Domain

Run Install-Package Dapper.Accelr8.Repo.Src in your repo project.

Remove binary references to
Dapper.Accelr8.Domain

Run Install-Package Dapper.Accelr8.Domain.Src in your domain project.

Make sure to include your domain project in your repository project, and both in your Sql project.

## How to setup
To prevent some odd behavior, close all other instances of Visual Studio.
Open the schema.ttinclude

Edit these variable to set the location of your output files for the templates.

Keep CacheLocatorResults set to false.

UseDirtyProperties adds dirty property tracking to your domain templates.
```
UseDirtyProperties = true;
```

These are the properties for your domain project.
The BaseDomainEntity variable allows you to use your own base entity class as long as it can fulfill the same Dapper.Accelr8.Domain IEntity.
```

public static string BaseDomainEntity = "Dapper.Accelr8.Repo.Domain.BaseEntity";
public static string DomainProject = "Dapper.Accelr8.Sql";
public static string DomainNamespace = @"Dapper.Accelr8.Domain";
public static string DomainDirectory = @"Domain";
```

These properties below are for generating the sql and belong somewhere in your sql project.
```
public static string WritersProject = "Dapper.Accelr8.Sql";
public static string WritersNamespace = @"Dapper.Accelr8.Writers";
public static string WritersDirectory = @"Writers";

public static string ReadersProject = "Dapper.Accelr8.Sql";
public static string ReadersNamespace = @"Dapper.Accelr8.Readers";
public static string ReadersDirectory = @"Readers";

public static string TableInfoProject = "Dapper.Accelr8.Sql";
public static string TableInfoNamespace = @"Dapper.Accelr8.TableInfos";
public static string TableInfoDirectory = @"TableInfos";
```

Set your connection string and database here.
```
static string _connectionString = @"Data Source=.\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;Integrated Security=SSPI;";
static string _database = @"AdventureWorks";
```		

These dictionaries hold name transformations..
```
static Dictionary<string, string> tableNames = new Dictionary<string, string>()
{
	{ "Order Details", "OrderDetails"}
};
```

Table Aliases cuts down the size of the sql generated when using large amounts of joins, and makes it easier to read.
```
static Dictionary<string, string> tableAliases = new Dictionary<string, string>()
{
	{ "Order Details", "oDetails" }
};
```

Column names makes your field names prettier also, it allows you to fine tune names which are hard to inflect to singular or plural.
```
static Dictionary<string, string> columnNames = new Dictionary<string, string>()
{
	{ "TitleOfCourtesy", "Courtesy" }
};
```

this adds a cast in front of the reads and reverses it for writes. This is for casting to enums or numbers. I will eventually support Enum parsing for strings, but not yet.
```
static Dictionary<string, string> columnTypes = new Dictionary<string, string>()
{
	{ "PostalCode", "int" }
};
```

In Order to ignore a table, column, or foreign key relationship, see these examples below:

To Ignore Tables see this comment:
```
//Tweak Tables Here.
```

And add C# code to ignore the tables you want.
```
tables["Territories"].Ignore = true;
```

To ignore columns and foreign keys, find this line:
```
//Tweak Columns / Relationships Here.
```

Add C# code below to ignore the column child or parent relation.
```
tables["Region"].Children["FK_Territories_Region"].Ignore = true;
tables["Customers"].Columns["Fax"].Ignore = true;
```

# Using Dependency Injection

 Dapper Accelr8 assumes, but does not require, that the user have some sort of IOC / DI already in place. Let's take a look at an example of how to wire up the three basic parts of the Dapper Accelr8or.

 The Accelr8 interface "IAccelr8Locator" is a dependency for the classes that need to dynamically access the other parts of repository and sql builders. It's what allows a reader to get readers for child classes and parent classes.

 This is the signature defined by the "IAccelr8Locator" interface.

```
object Resolve(Type type);
object Resolve(Type type, string name);
I Resolve<I>();
I Resolve<I>(string name);
```

 Here's an example of integrating it with Ninject (note that the _kernal variable represents an instance of the ninject Kernal class):

```
public virtual object Resolve(Type type)
{
    return _kernel.Get(type);
}

public virtual object Resolve(Type type, string name)
{
    return _kernel.Get(type, name);
}

public virtual I Resolve<I>()
{
    return _kernel.Get<I>();
}

public virtual I Resolve<I>(string name)
{
    return _kernel.Get<I>(name);
}
```

 You will need to bind this interface before binding any of the other classes in the Dapper Accelr8or suite.

 The DapperExecuter class will also need to be wired up, here is an example of doing so in ninject:

 ```
 _kernel.Bind<DapperExecuter>().ToConstant<DapperExecuter>(new DapperExecuter
    (new Dictionary<string, string>(){ {"MyConnectionString", "Data Source=.\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=NORTHWND;Integrated Security=SSPI;"));
 ```

### Important

 The "QueryBuilder" and "JoinBuilder" are self bindable and do not need explicit registrations in ninject. In other IOC / DI frameworks this may not be the case and they may need to be bound.

Even though this may seem like a complicated solution, remeber that IOC reduces complexity, and allows for better unit testing. For my own projects I have created a SQLLite version of the Dapper Executer, allowing for db independent unit testing off all my applications.

### Registering the TableInfo Classes.

 This shows an example of registering a TableInfo class with ninject;
 the TableInfo class is designed to be registered staticly as to reduce processing time in creating and sorting the table data everytime a reader or writer is created.

```
 _kernel.Bind<ProductTableInfo>().To<ProductTableInfo>(new ProductTableInfo(_kernel.Get<IAccelr8Locator>())).InSingletonScope();
```

### Registering the Reader Classes.

```
_kernel.Bind<IEntityReader<int, Product>>().To<ProductReader>().WithConstructorArgument("connectionStringName", "MyConnectionString");
```

### Registering the Writer Classes.

```
_kernel.Bind<IEntityWriter<int, Product>>().To<ProductWriter>().WithConstructorArgument("connectionStringName", "MyConnectionString");
```

# Using the Query Language

 Using the query language is simple, here is an example of pulling a user from a database / domain that has a user table. I'm using Ninject for my dependency injection so you can see how to retreive the repository.

 ```
 var repo = _kernal.Get<IRepository<User>>();
 var user = repo.Select(new QueryElement()
 {
 	FieldName = UserColumnNames.UserName.ToString(),
 	Operator = Operator.Equals,
 	Value = "User1"
 }).FirstOrDefault();
 ```

Here's an example of pulling the first 10 users with names that match search criteria:

```
 var users = repo.Select(new QueryElement()
 {
 	FieldName = UserColumnNames.UserName.ToString(),
 	Operator = Operator.Like,
 	Value = "Billy"
 }, 0, 10);
 ```

 the 0 indicates the amount of records to skip, and the 10 indicates the records to take. These parameters are executed in SQL.
